## Maaji Static Theme

A static website for Maaji restaurant. It's only a static theme with very little
JS. Although the purpose of this theme is not making a fully functional website but to
show how things were done the old way e.g floating grid system.

A follow up repo will show the same project using a grid system based on
Flexbox. It will generally show how Flexbox makes things easier.
